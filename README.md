## Seneca course 

this course teaches me that how to build Business applications on IBM midrange and mainframe systems and to be used on many device platforms, including mobile. 

Working with the IBM i system, this course teaches me how to create new apps, and extend existing apps, for Android and iOS device platforms.

IBM i platform programming technologies, including RPG and the integrated database, are used to build apps which can be deployed to a mobile device. Device features can be integrated, including communication, location, and media capture. The result can transform and modernize an organizationâ€™s line-of-business applications while leveraging existing IBM i knowledge.
